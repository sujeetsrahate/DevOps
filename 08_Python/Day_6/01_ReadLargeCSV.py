  """

  Reads a large CSV file in chunks and processes the data.

  Args:

    filepath: The path to the CSV file.

    chunksize: The number of rows to read and process at a time.

          Useful for handling files that don't fit in memory.

  Returns:

    None. Prints the processed data or performs other actions.
